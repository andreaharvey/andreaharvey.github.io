<h1><strong>Andrea Harvey</strong></h1>
<p>Hello, I'm a journalism student at the University of Oregon School of Journalism and Communication. Currently, I am an opinion columnist and special sections contributor for the Daily Emerald, a writer for Her Campus Oregon, and a copy editor for Envision Magazine. I also outsource optimized content for Effective Web Solutions, and internet marketing business located in Washougal, Washington. I love multimedia journalism and everything that goes into it, but my strongest passion is writing. I am originally from Portland, Oregon and in my free time, I enjoy crafty things and going on outdoor adventures! Most of all, I love meeting new people, traveling to new places, and learning new things.</p>
