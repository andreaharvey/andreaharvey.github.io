  <div class="about">       

  <p>Hi, my name is Andrea Harvey. I&lsquo;m a writer, an editor, an arts and culture enthusiast and a passionate student journalist from Portland, Oregon. <br><br>

Currently, I&lsquo;m the opinion editor for the <i><a href="http://dailyemerald.com/author/andreah/" target="_blank">Daily Emerald</a></i>, a newspaper at the University of Oregon that&lsquo;s been recognized nationally for its digital-first revolution. Aside from leading a small team of columnists, editing content and collaborating with the editorial board, I try to involve myself in anything arts and culture. Before becoming opinion editor, I directed special sections, which included various issues focused on student life. Additionally, I write whenever I get a chance, including anchors, columns and cover stories. <br><br>

The skills that have allowed me to succeed in almost any work environment include teamwork, organization, communication and attention to detail. The trait that has led me to excel in journalism, however, is my passion for learning and writing about the world around me. From that, everything else comes naturally.<br><br>

In the office, I&lsquo;m known for having an open mind and always saying <i>yes.</i> Whether that&lsquo;s in the form of taking over someone&lsquo;s job or writing an article last minute to fill an empty slot, I&lsquo;m on it. Additionally, I ask for constructive criticism and advice as often as I can. My eagerness to be involved has landed me with multiple stressful deadlines at times, but I never regret it. I&lsquo;ll stay up all night if I have to and I&lsquo;ve done it many times with no regrets.<br><br>

In my free time, I love to read, listen to all kinds of music, eat real sushi and go on adventures outside.<br><br>

Have questions? Interested in hiring me? Feel free to email me at any time.
